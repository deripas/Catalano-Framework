Catalano Framework (Maven version)
=========

The Catalano Framework is a framework for scientific computing for Java and Android. The project started as an initial port of the many features of the [AForge.NET] and [Accord.NET] frameworks for .NET, but is steadily growing with more advanced features which are now being shared between those projects.

The project is organized under the same architecture found in the afore mentioned frameworks. Experienced users who would wish to leverage their expertise on Accord and AForge to work on Android can rely on the same namespaces for:

  - Image Processing
  - IO
  - Fuzzy Logic
  - Graph
  - Math
  - Statistics
  - Machine Learning
  - Neural Network
  - Signal
  - Vision
